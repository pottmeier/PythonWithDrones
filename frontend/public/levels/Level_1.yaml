  Welcome to **Level 1** - Basic Movement!
  
  We are here to teach you the basics of Python!<br>
  In this application for better understanding we are using a drone to show you what is possible.<br>
  Try to reach the end of the level by combining the instructions.<br>
  <br>
  The world you are seeing is where the drone can move, if you try to escape it or are moving for instance into a tree,<br>
  the drone will crash and the level needs to be reset.<br>
  
  ### Instructions:
  1. Use the command `drone.move()` to fly forward.
  2. Reach the <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">Portal</span> to end the Level!
  3. Don't crash into the <span class="text-purple-500 font-bold">World</span> <span class="text-purple-500">Border</span>.
