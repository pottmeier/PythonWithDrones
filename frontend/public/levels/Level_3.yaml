  Welcome to **Level 3** - Loops & Variables!
  Have you noticed yourself typing `drone.move()` over and over? There's a smarter way!
  Python's **for loop** lets you repeat an action multiple times without rewriting the same line 
  and with **variables**, you can store values and reuse them. Think of a variable as a labeled box that holds a value.

  **Note:** Loops require a certain syntax to work. A for loop needs an iterator i and something iterable such as a range(), after that
  a colon is needed to explain to python that now an idented block is comming and the iterator uses the block. Look at the example for a better understanding.

  ### Example
  ```code
  STEPS = 5
  for i in range(STEPS):
      drone.move()
  ```
  Instead of calling `drone.move()` five times, we store the number in `STEPS` and let the loop handle the rest.<br>
  Now use what you've learned to complete the level!
