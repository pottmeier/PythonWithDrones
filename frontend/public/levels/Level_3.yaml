  Welcome to **Level 3** - Loops!

  You might have noticed you are writing `drone.move()` over and over again.<br>
  In Python there is a smarter way to repeat actions — the **for loop**!<br>
  <br>
  Instead of writing the same command 5 times, you can write it once inside a loop.<br>

  ### Example:
  ```python
  for i in range(5):
      drone.move()
  ```
