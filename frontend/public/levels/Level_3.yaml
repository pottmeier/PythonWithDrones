  Welcome to **Level 3** - Loops & Variables!
  Have you noticed yourself typing `drone.move()` over and over? There's a smarter way!
  Python's **for loop** lets you repeat an action multiple times without rewriting the same line.<br>
  And with **variables**, you can store values and reuse them — think of a variable as a labeled box that holds a value.

  ```python
  STEPS = 5
  for i in range(STEPS):
      drone.move()
  ```
  Instead of calling `drone.move()` five times, we store the number in `STEPS` and let the loop handle the rest.<br>
  Now use what you've learned to complete the level!
