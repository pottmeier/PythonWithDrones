  Welcome to **Level 6** - While Loops!

  You have used `for` loops with a fixed count.<br>
  But what if you don't know how many steps you need?<br>
  That's where the **while loop** comes in!<br>

  ### Instructions:
  - Use `drone.at_portal()` to check wether the drone is at the finish portal or not.
  - Use a while loop to keep moving until a condition is met.
  - Use everything you learned up until this point!
  - Reach the <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">Portal</span> to end the Level!
  - Don't crash into the <span class="text-purple-500 font-bold">World</span> <span class="text-purple-500">Border</span>.

  ### Example:
  ```code
  while not False:
    print("This will be printed forever!")
  ```
spawn: { x: 1, y: 1, z: 9 }
