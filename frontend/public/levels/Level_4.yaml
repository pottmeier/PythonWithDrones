  Welcome to **Level 4** - Functions!

  You have learned loops and variables. Now let's take it further with **functions**!
  A function is a **reusable block of code** you give a name to. You can also use functions with parameters like variables see the example.<br>
  Like loops functions in python rely on identation, blocks you want in that function need to be idented!
  ### Instructions:
  - Define a def function for the repeating path pattern.
  - Call your function multiple times.
  - Reach the <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">Portal</span> to end the Level!

  ### Example:
  
  ```code
  def move(steps):
    for i in range(steps)
      drone.move()

  move(1)
  move(2)
  ```
  <br>
  The path ahead repeats a pattern, define a function to handle it cleanly!
