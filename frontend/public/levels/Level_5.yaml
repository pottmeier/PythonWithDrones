  Welcome to **Level 5** - Conditionals!

  Sometimes your drone needs to **make a decision**.<br>
  In Python we use `if` and `else` to do different things based on a condition.<br>
  The if and else works with `True` and `False` values for that, which means if the `if` should check for
  a number we need to compare that number, look in the example for better understanding.

  ### Instructions
  - Use `drone.is_path_blocked()` together with if to check whether the block in front of the drone is a world border or something else that blocks the path
  - Reach the <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">Portal</span> to end the Level!
  - Don't crash into the <span class="text-purple-500 ">World Border</span> or the tree.

  ### Example
  ```code
  value = 5
  if (value <= 5):
    print("value is smaller or equals 5")
  else:
    print("value is greater than 5")
  ```
